	abstract={Driven by the upsurge in global (out-)sourcing and the changing expectations of organizations'' stakeholders, companies are increasingly being held responsible for the actions of their suppliers. Subsequently, Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) has emerged as an important factor in safeguarding organizations from being accused of irresponsible behavior. Grounded on the concept of ethical culture, the research in this paper identifies elements for guiding PSM behavior towards socially and environmentally sustainable supplier selection. Results indicate that different elements of the firms'' ethical culture have a significant impact on how purchasing managers account for social and environmental criteria when selecting suppliers.

	abstract={Nowadays, due to the importance of competition in supply chain, supplier selection is one of the most important issues in competition between manufacturers. Different companies take various criteria into account to select the appropriate suppliers. In this paper, we study a supplier selection problem, considering three key criteria: price, quality and delivery performance. For the first time in this paper a single-echelon supply chain has been studied at which each manufacturer tries not only to optimise his/her own situation but also to remove the other buyers from their optimum points. Hence, this paper considered a new competitive supplier selection problem with some assumption according to real world. In addition, because of new assumptions and complexity of the studied problem, an Imperialist Competitive Algorithm has been used to solve the problem. Finally the success of the mentioned model will be supported by a numerical example and the difference between decision making in competitive and non-competitive market will be shown.},

	abstract={The purpose of this paper is to propose a decision support model for supplier selection based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) using a case of automotive industry in a developing country of Pakistan and further performs sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the supplier selection decision. : The model starts by identifying the main criteria (price, quality, delivery and service) using literature review and ranking the main criteria based on experts' opinions using AHP. The second stage in the adopted methodology is the identification of sub criteria and ranking them on the basis of main criteria. Lastly perform sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the decision using Expert ChoiceTMsoftware. : The suppliers are selected and ranked based on sub criteria. Sensitivity analysis suggests the effects of changes in the main criteria on the suppliers ranking. The use of AHP in the supplier selection gives the decision maker the confidence of the consistency and the robustness throughout the process. :The AHP methodology adopted in this study provides managers in automotive industry in Pakistan with the insights of the various factors that need to be considered while selecting suppliers for their organizations. The selected approach also aids them in prioritizing the criterion. Managers can utilize the hierarchical structure of adopted supplier selection methodology suggested in this study to rank the suppliers on the basis of various factors/criteria. : This study makes three novel contributions in supplier selection area. First, AHP is applied to automotive industry and use of AHP in the supplier selection gives decision maker the confidence of the consistency. Second, sensitivity analysis enables in understanding the effects of changes in the main criteria on the suppliers ranking and help decision maker to check the robustness throughout the process. Last, we find it important to come with a simple methodology for managers of automotive industry so that they can select the best suppliers. Moreover, this approach will also help managers in dividing the complex decision making problem into simpler hierarchy.},

	abstract={Selecting the most sustainable biomass crop type for biofuel production is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving various conflicting criteria. In this paper, we propose a unique stochastic analytical hierarchy process (AHP) that can handle uncertain information and identify weights of criteria in the MCDM problem. By utilizing the beta distribution and approximating its median, we convert various types of expert evaluations including imprecise values into crisp values. We ensure consistency in each evaluation matrix before aggregating expert judgments. We then demonstrate use of the model by applying it to sustainable biomass crop selection. In order to define a comprehensive list of the selection criteria, we utilize the existing literature and opinions of experts including farmers, government specialists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and faculty members in the areas of biomass and bioenergy. The evaluation model includes three main sustainability criteria defined as economic, environmental, and social aspects associated with a total of 16 sub-criteria. We apply the proposed model to biomass alternatives including switchgrass, Miscanthus, sugarcane, corn, and wheat in Kansas. Results show the weights of economic, environmental, and social aspects to be 0.59, 0.26, and 0.15, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the score of switchgrass increases if environmental criteria are emphasized. On the other hand, wheat and corn become more favorable than other alternatives if priority is given to economic factors. The most sustainable biomass sources in different regions can be determined by applying the presented selection hierarchy. The proposed stochastic AHP methodology can also be utilized for other complex multi-criteria decision-making problems with uncertain information and multiple stakeholders.},

	author={ Hoek, R. V. },
	year={2020},
	abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic is causing risks and disruptions in most supply chains. As supply chain managers are responding to these risks, several theories may inform those efforts. In this paper, we explore across seven companies in different industries, supply chain positions and countries, how lessons from total costs of ownership, supplier segmentation and supply chain change management theory may apply to efforts to respond to COVID-19 supply chain risks and disruptions. The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead. Our findings also paint a more nuanced and complex picture than offered in the popular press; the focus on nearshoring does not necessarily mean leaving China and the switch in total costs of ownership may only be partial and temporal. Limitations of the theories considered are identified and resulting suggestions for managers and further research are developed.},

	year={2020},
	abstract={An intertwined supply network (ISN) is an entirety of interconnected supply chains (SC) which, in their integrity secure the provision of society and markets with goods and services. The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability. We illustrate the viability formation through a dynamic game-theoretic modelling of a biological system that resembles the ISN. We discuss some future research areas.},

	author={D Ivanov},
	journal={Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review},
	volume={136},
	abstract={Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model鈥檚 behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.},
